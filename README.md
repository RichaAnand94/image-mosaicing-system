PROJECT Name: Image Mosaicing System

Supervisor Name: Dr. Rajiv Kumar

Group Number : 26

Groupmate Name: Priyanshi Singh and Rakhi Singh

Details:

Image mosaicing system  enables to combine together many small images into a one large image. A mosaiced image is the composition of sequence of images , it can be obtained by finding out the coordinate relationship between the overlapping images. This coordinate relationship is between the pixels of one image and in another image which creates a mosaiced image. This relationship must be develop carefully to match the pixels between two images. This is done with the help of homography estimation. 

This project includes three main procedures :

.>Image Acquisition

.>Image Registration

.>Image Blending

Image Acquisition:

The first stage of Image Mosaicing system is the image acquisition stage. The image which is taken from  digital camera is used for mosaicing the image .

Image Registration:

The process of transforming the different sets of data into one coordinate system. This includes two main process: feature detection and feature mapping.

Image Blending:

It is a technique which modifies the image gray levels in the vicinity of a boundary to obtain a smooth transition between images.It is done to minimize the visibility of seams between images.

Using these we create a mosaiced image, which is a overlapping of two or more images of same scene.
