PROJECT Name: Image Mosaicing System
Supervisor Name: Dr. Rajiv Kumar
Group Number : 26
Groupmate Name: Priyanshi Singh and Rakhi Singh

Details:
Image mosaicing system  enables to combine together many small images into a one large image. A mosaiced image is the composition of sequence of images , it can be obtained by finding out the coordinate relationship between the overlapping images. This coordinate relationship is between the pixels of one image and in another image which creates a mosaiced image. This relationship must be develop carefully to match the pixels between two images. This is done with the help of homography estimation. 
This project includes three main procedures :
.>Image Acquisition
.>Image Registration
.>Image Blending

Image Acquisition:
The first stage of Image Mosaicing system is the image acquisition stage. The image which is taken from  digital camera is used for mosaicing the image .
Image Registration:
The process of transforming the different sets of data into one coordinate system. This includes two main process: feature detection and feature mapping.
Image Blending:
It is a technique which modifies the image gray levels in the vicinity of a boundary to obtain a smooth transition between images.It is done to minimize the visibility of seams between images.
Using these we create a mosaiced image, which is a overlapping of two or more images of same scene.
